The Warehousing and Logistics Industry in Australia generates an enormous amount of data every day (DHL [2013](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee/#5277)), which creates great opportunities for businesses. However, this data is not currently being used to maximum efficiency ([Zhong et al. 2015](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee/#b1e5)). Furthermore, if used correctly, data and statistical analysis provides immense opportunity for businesses and generates significant competitive advantage ([Wang et al. 2016](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee/#d730)). By leveraging the data which already exists within the business, organisations can extract substantial value over multiple facets of the business, including guiding high-level strategic directions, assisting day-to-day tactical decisions, and reducing the cost-overhead caused when Service-Level Agreements (SLA’s) are not met. Jia, Wang & Wei ([2015](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee/#9570)) discuss that the key to achieving this business success is through real-time data analytics and user-friendly visualisation. Moreover, Davenport & Harris ([2007](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee/#5da9)) emphasise the direct link between a business’s degree of competitive advantage and its degree of data intelligence. The use of data, and the realisation of in-depth statistical analysis is also an area where the warehousing and logistics industry is yet to achieve great outcomes ([Bamberger et al. 2017](https://chrimaho.medium.com/the-contemporary-logistics-industry-2ed36d4404ee#8b75)).
