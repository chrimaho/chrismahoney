Our World today has many issues, and the Prevalence of Undernourishment is just one of them. Over the past twenty years, the United Nations, through the Food and Agriculture Organisation ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/home/en/)), has collected data on many countries, and have helped to influence and improve their Undernourishment overall.

This report, and the associated [Data Exploration App](https://chrimaho.shinyapps.io/ExploringUndernourishment/), looks to explore the data provided by the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/home/en/), and to understand itâ€™s nuances, to learn what information it is telling us, and to derive meaning from it. The research activities undertaken focus on four key areas:

1. [General Trends](https://medium.com/@chrimaho/exploring-undernourishment-part-4-research-area-1-general-trend-cdb8ced5b0af?source=friends_link&sk=30922587311cccfd051e40e90e4bf3b8);
2. [Most Successful Countries](https://medium.com/@chrimaho/exploring-undernourishment-part-5-research-area-2-most-successful-countries-c0afd1504c71?source=friends_link&sk=8da658166ca6d80b3cd9613b26ab02f1);
3. [Surprising Trends](https://medium.com/@chrimaho/exploring-undernourishment-part-6-research-area-3-surprising-trends-962d653a08fc?source=friends_link&sk=d6ba983f77a0f08176d2d916033c4b52); and 
4. [The Most Influential Indicator](https://medium.com/@chrimaho/exploring-undernourishment-part-7-research-area-4-most-influential-indicator-47ba76395f9b?source=friends_link&sk=5eab78561820fe6e0dd5b3ade028e1b5).

This report embarks on an exploratory data analysis through the narratives told by this data.
