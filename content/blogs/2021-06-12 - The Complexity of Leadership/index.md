Leadership is a complex process. It requires inspiring the hearts and minds of a group of followers, and to collectively achieve a common goal. However, everybody is different, and every situation is different; and even the same people, in the same situation, at a different point in time, will yield a vastly different result. So then, how is a leader able to be successful in all situations? And also, why are some people successful leaders while others appear to struggle when placed in a leadership position? Or, more importantly, how can an individual learn to improve their own leadership skillset over time?

The Academic community has spent many years conceiving many different theories and concepts to describe what leadership is. Some of these concepts come close to encapsulating the essence of leadership (eg. Authentic Leadership); while others are focussed on very specific types of leadership (eg. Servant Leadership). However, there are many contradictions and confusions present in this framework. As yet, there is still no consensus within Academia for the definition of leadership.

When thinking pragmatically, we only need to look toward some practical examples practical examples of leadership to see the just how complex leadership can be. Here, the examples of Ricardo Semler and Julie Hammer provide a good medium for contrasting drastically different leadership styles, both of which have been remarkably successful in their own right. Therefore, it is easy to see just how complex and nuanced leadership can be.
