In January this year, I was part of the facilitation team on the annual Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA) course in North Sydney. It is a week-long experiential leadership program, aimed at empowering the next generation of leaders to achieve great things.

The program is designed around a reflectively experiential approach to leadership, employing the abstraction of ‘ERLA’ to assist the participants through their journey. ERLA is an abbreviation for: Experience, Reflection, Learning, Action. This concept is continually reinforced throughout the course of the week.

In this article, I will discuss all four parts of 'ERLA' from both an experiential and also an academic perspective.
