<b>Description</b>

{{% show-more %}}
The Bachelor of Business and Commerce (Advanced Business Leadership) degree is a broadly based, multi-discipline undergraduate course offering flexibility and choice through a range of nine different Majors, each of which reflects a particular business discipline. The Major I have chosen is Management. The degree seeks to equip its students with a sound understanding of business issues, complemented by a high level of knowledge relevant to a specific business discipline. The Management discipline has a capstone unit called Contemporary Management Issues. This unit allowed me to graduate 'business ready', and has prepared me to deal with real world business issues and problems and generate real world business solutions. The intention of the course is to provide a foundation for the development of Australia’s future business leaders.
