With the aim of establishing reasons behind the skills shortage in Western Sydney, we identified the three below paradoxes:

1. Businesses want recruits who have the skills and experience; yet are unwilling to provide training for new recruits.<br>
2. Businesses were not able to provide training-type employment; yet demand for all future employees to be adequately experienced.<br>
3. Governments are scaling-back incentive for businesses to up-skill their employees on the job; yet training organisations were struggling to find businesses to provide job placement training.
